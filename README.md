Demo based on an interview.

Consists of three services:

| Service            | Description                                              |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Floor Plan Service | Provides the cameras available on a floor.               |
| Camera Serivce     | Gives details (such as location) for a camera.           |
| Locator Service    | Tells us which cameras are closest to a reference camera. |


For now: run each service separately, make REST calls to the Locator Service.
